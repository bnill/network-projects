HIGH LEVEL APPROACH
====================
The high level approach of this program is to implement low-level operations of the Internet protocol stack, here we created a program called rawhtttpget , this program  takes url link as script argument and will download the associated file from that link.
	We started to design the program by creating raw socket for IP, TCP, HTTP  and we also designed the code for handling checksum, (cwnd)congestion window, timeout handling, 
validating IP and error handling.
	We also handled complete 3 way handshake process of TCP/IP by sending SYN packet for first handshake, Receiving SYN, ACK for second handshake and sending ACK bit set for 
third handshake
	Once we established TCP handshake, we created HTTP GET message to fetch required URL and we received the http response from server and filtered for required packets and saved 
the associated file and finally we also tear down the connection from both ends.
	For downloaded filename, if url link contains only servername say "www.ccs.neu.edu" , the downloaded file is named as "index.html" and for other links
ex: say "http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/project4.php" , the downloaded filename is named as "project4.php"  and saved in the destination folder currently executed
	We handled script arguments validation and also URL validation for entered URL to check to be in valid format or not.
    We also handled congestion mechanism, by updating the value of CWND when required ACK_number and SEQ_number is received
	Finally for timeout issues, We handled retransmission mechnanisms for either to resend or abort the program based on requirement.

CHALLENGE FACED
=================
1. while handling random sequence number for Setting the ack_to_receive value and seq_to_receive value
2. while unpacking the TCP and IP packet based on the format given in RFC
3. while retrieving the local IP address and the host address required
4. while dealing with timeout, retransmission and Finishing process of TCP connection.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
================================
1. One must run this program with root privileges (using sudo command) , the format of the execution command is 
./rawhttpget <url to be downloaded>

ex:./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/project4.php

2. Before executing the program, one have to execute iptables command to set the rule in iptables to drop outgoing TCP RST packets , and the command is 
"iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP"

3. This program doesnt support https and it doesnt handles other http response codes other than status 200 OK

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TEST CASE SCENARIOS:
==========================================

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/
OUTPUT : file with name index.html is downloaded and verified the same using wget

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/2MB.log
OUTPUT : file with name 2MB.log is downloaded

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/10MB.log
OUTPUT :  file with name 10MB.log is downloaded

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/50MB.log 
OUTPUT : file with name 50MB.log is downloaded 

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/ http://ccs.neu.edu/
OUTPUT: Error message "Invalid number of script arguments passed" will be displayed

sudo ./rawhttpget 
OUTPUT: Error message "Invalid number of script arguments passed" will be displayed

sudo ./rawhttpget abcisaguy
OUTPUT: Error message "Url validation failed: Enter Correct URL link" will be displayed

sudo ./rawhttpget http://david.choffnes.com/classes/cs4700fa16/20000000MB.log
OUTPUT: Error message is displayed at the console
